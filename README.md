# 🌍 Life Expectancy Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **life expectancy data** using Python in **Google Colab**. The dataset includes multiple features like 'Country', 'Year', 'Status', 'Life expectancy ', 'Adult Mortality',
'infant deaths', 'Alcohol', 'percentage expenditure', 'Hepatitis B','Measles ', ' BMI ', 'under-five deaths ', 'Polio', 'Total expenditure', 'Diphtheria ', ' HIV/AIDS', 'GDP', 'Population',' thinness  1-19 years', ' thinness 5-9 years', 'Income composition of resources'and 'Schooling'

## 📁 Files

- `Data_analysis_project_1.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook.
- `Life Expectancy Data.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Load and explore the dataset.
- Clean the data: handle missing values, drop duplicates.
- Perform basic analysis such as:
  - Yearly distribution of data entries.
  - Most frequent countries in the dataset.
  - Observing factors related to life expectancy.
  - Create visualizations using Matplotlib.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Year 2013** had the highest number of recorded entries.
- Most countries had consistent life expectancy data across years.
- Health-related features like GDP, education (schooling), and mortality impact life expectancy significantly.
